Here are a few tips on using them in Cacher.\n\n## Markdown\n\n![](https://cdn.cacher.io/intro-snippets/editing-markdown.gif)\n\n[Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is one of the most widely used snippet types in Cacher for documentation. We've added a few enhancements to make it even more useful.\n\nTo create a Markdown snippet, simply give your snippet file a `.md` extension or click the **dropdown arrow** next to the **New Snippet** button and choose **Markdown**.\n\n### Task Lists\n\n![](https://cdn.cacher.io/intro-snippets/markdown-task-list.gif)\n\nYou can create Task Lists to keep track of todos and other checklists. Click the **Add a task list** button in the Markdown editor toolbar to add a Task List item. You can also enter [the syntax](https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/108f62b6b8d8dd18610c#F0_MH--syntax) into the editor directly.\n\n### Attachments\n\n![](https://cdn.cacher.io/intro-snippets/markdown-uploading-images.gif)\n\nYou can directly upload images or files to insert into your Markdown document. Click the **Attach File** button and select one or more files to upload. \n\nFor an even faster way of uploading files, just **drag and drop** them into the editor area.\n\n### Exporting\n\nYou can export Markdown files by clicking on **HTML** or **PDF** options in the snippet file header.\n\n## Syncing with GitHub Gist\n\nAny users who have signed in with GitHub will automatically have their personal library snippets synced with GitHub Gist. [Learn more](https://www.cacher.io/docs/guides/snippets/syncing-with-github-gist) about sync.\n\n## Snippet File History\n\n![](https://cdn.cacher.io/intro-snippets/view-lines-diff.gif)\n\nEvery snippet file in Cacher comes with its own update history.

Choose whether the label will be **Private**.\n5. If you are creating a nested label, select a label for **Child Label Of**.\n6. Click **Save** to create the label.\n\n\n## Assigning a label to a snippet\n\nAssigning a label to a snippet gives you the ability to easily browse for and find the snippet via search filters.
