# test note

This is a test note to show the type of files that Reflect creates. While we do have a heading, we do not have a title. Let's add a tag:

\#person

We can also link to another note by its name like this: [[The Canine Coach]] is another note I have.

Not sure what else to include, but happy to submit anything else that would be useful.
