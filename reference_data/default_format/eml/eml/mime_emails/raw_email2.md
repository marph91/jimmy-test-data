Hi,

Just started to use my xxxxxxxx account (to set-up a GTD system,
natch) and noticed that when I send content via email the signature/
certificate from my email account gets added as a file (e.g.
"smime.p7s").

Obviously I can uncheck the signature option in the Mail compose
window but how often will I remember to do that?

Is there any way these kind of files could be ignored, e.g. via some
sort of exclusions list?


[smime.p7s](./smime.p7s)
