The fog comes
on little cat feet.

The fog comes
on little cat feet.

The fog comes
on little cat feet.

**Poetry**

The fog comes
on little cat feet.

<a name="sandburg"></a>The fog comes
on little cat feet.

> The fog comes
> on little cat feet.
>
> It sits looking
> over harbor and city
> on silent haunches
> and then moves on.
