An audio memo recording has been attached - it is silent because Note Station does not record correctly on my computers (if the feature actually works) but this shows it is exported.

An example-attachment.pdf has been attached

This page has 4 tags Tag1, Tag2, Tag1/SubTag1, Tag1/SubTag1/SubSubTag1. There will be near the top of the markdown file.

This is some code pasted into the note

```
if not files_to_convert:
    print('No .nsx files found')
    exit(1)
```

There is no way to insert 'code' in line in a Note.  Note formatted HTML does not use the ` tag it just uses a `

     tag so code is always it's own block even if only one word. Just like

```
while
```

this.

A pdf of what this page looks like in Note Station has been attached - see test page.pdf
