## Details

The Desktop application's Sidebar contains adjustable widgets. The main screen of the mobile app also has the same feature. On both platforms, you can add your own created objects or use the system widgets as

- **Favorites**
This section includes objects marked as favorites.
- **Sets**
This section contains all the sets available in the application. A set is a filter based on object type, such as tasks in the Task Tracker or notes in the My Notes set.
- **Collections**
Collections are like personal databases where you can store objects of any type.
- **Recently Edited Objects**
This section shows recently edited objects that synchronize across all devices.

- **Recently Opened Objects**
This section works independently on each device and displays objects that have been recently opened locally.
