### 1. Create an Object

Press the + button in the Navigation Bar at the bottom of the window. Congrats - you've just created an **Object**! By default, your new object's **Type** is 'Note'. We use object types to categorise objects and make them meaningful. [Study Objects](https://doc.anytype.io/anytype-docs/basics/object-editor)↗︎

### 2. Add content

Inside an object, just start writing text, or type / to add a **Block** – a dynamic piece of content. You can choose various block types, customise, and re-arrange them to create beautiful canvasses. [Study Blocks](https://doc.anytype.io/anytype-docs/basics/object-editor/blocks)↗︎

### **3. Link & Embed Object**s

Open the / menu and scroll down to the *Objects* section. From here, you can create a **New Object** inside the existing one, which will automatically link them. 

You can also link an existing object using the @ symbol or selecting **Link Object** from the / menu.

### 4. Organise Objects

To manage multiple objects in Anytype, you have **Sets** and **Collections**.

- **Sets** allow you to create a dynamic queries that group **Objects** based on their **Type**. For instance, the 'Tasks ' in sidebar is a Set, containing all objects with the 'Task' type. [Study Sets](https://doc.anytype.io/anytype-docs/basics/sets)↗︎
- **Collections** offer a folder-like structure, letting you organize various objects in one place. [Study Collections](https://doc.anytype.io/anytype-docs/basics/collections)[↗︎]()
To create a Set or a Collection, click the + button and select the desired option on top of your new obejct.

### Next steps

This was a *basic* introduction of what you can do in Anytype.

Unlock the full potential of Anytype by delving into **Ob[ject Types**](https://doc.anytype.io/anytype-docs/basics/types)↗︎ and **Re[lations**](https://doc.anytype.io/anytype-docs/basics/relations)↗︎. Object Types categorize and define your data, whereas Relations add meaningful linkages and attributes to your objects.
