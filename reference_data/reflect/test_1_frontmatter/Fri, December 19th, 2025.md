- Today I started using [Reflect](./Reflect.md)

- How should I use [Reflect](./Reflect.md)?

- Record everything that happens in your day from your daily note (in a list just like this!)

- Write to do lists and items, a running log of what happens in your day, people you meet, ideas, daily reflections, etc.

- You can watch workflow videos showing how to use Reflect on our [YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/@reflect-notes).

- We've created a note for you on [How to use Reflect](<./How to use Reflect.md>) in case you need to reference it at any time.

- Use AI to organize your notes

- Pull up the AI palette editor using **cmd J**

- Chat with your notes with AI through our advanced search (**cmd K**)

- If you're not yet familiar, learn about [how to use backlinks](https://reflect.academy/linking-your-notes)
