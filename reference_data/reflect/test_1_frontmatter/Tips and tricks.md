# Tips and tricks

Here are a few of our favorite ways of using [Reflect](./Reflect.md).

## Toggle between lists and tasks

When in a list:

- hit `cmd return` to toggle between a list-item, checkbox and marked checkbox

- Hit `cmd shift return` to toggle between a list-item, Task and marked Task

![toggle list](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FRzMNsM9Yy6MSukW9heBcayO8qGH3%2F61b4aa9462f9456a9098290a59c6a57f?alt=media&token=b6af5a1d-d058-4201-adaa-cba35d4600f9)

## Moving and collapsing bullet points

Move bullet points up or down by using `option up` and `option down`.

You can also drag and drop list items both vertically, and horizontally to indent them. `tab` and `shift tab` will also indent a list-item.

You can also collapse parent bullets to clean up complex lists.

## Focus Mode

If you either resize Reflect to a smaller window, or hit `cmd shift f`, you go into 'no-distract' mode which removes the side bars.

Bonus points, hit `cmd control f` to go full-screen, and then `cmd shift f` to enable no-distract mode for the ultimate writing experience.

Just hit `cmd` to exit focus mode.

## Back to the future

It can be useful to write yourself notes in the future. For example, some people like prepping for the week ahead by writing in each daily note.

Both the command palette and backlink support relative dates. This means you can type dates like: `3 days from now`, `one year ago`, `next thursday`, and you'll be sent to the right place.

## Navigate back/forward

Use the keyboard commands `cmd [` and `cmd ]` to navigate back and forward. We've stolen this behavior from your browser, so you should feel right at home.

## Select and backlink

You can backlink text by highlighting it and typing `[[`

![select and backlink](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/reflect-prod.appspot.com/o/users%2FRzMNsM9Yy6MSukW9heBcayO8qGH3%2Ffb2fc2844d6d4e99a7819d509ccb62a4?alt=media&token=e08eed18-f034-400a-bab1-944b50bb68a8)

## Note aliases

Sometimes you'll want to alias notes. For example, it's easier to type `Mum` than `Charlotte MacCaw`. We've made this simple in Reflect, just use a double forward-slash (`//`) in the subject line of notes to automatically alias each part.

For example, here our note is called `Charlotte MacCaw // Mum` :

## De-duplicate notes

Notes with the same subject at the top will automatically prompt you to de-duplicate and merge them when you click into the title.

## Quick text-edit commands

- ==highlight== text by surrounding it with `==` on each side of the text

- ~~strikethrough~~ text by highlighting it and using `cmd shift x`

- ++underline++ text by highlighting it and using `cmd u`

- create a code block by typing ````` (don't miss the space at the end) on a new line

```markup
like this!
```


- You can access additional buttons on the mobile editor by swiping the bar to the left
