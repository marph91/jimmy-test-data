## Creating your first snippet

If you haven't done so already, now would be a great time to create your first Cacher snippet.

1. Click the **New Snippet** button to compose a new snippet.
2. Enter a **Snippet Title**. (Cacher can search on this field so make it descriptive).
3. Optionally enter a **Description**. (You can use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to provide formatting.)
4. For the first file, enter a **Filename** with an extension. (e.g. `example.py`). (Cacher uses the extension to pick a filetype and provide syntax highlighting.)
5. Enter the file's contents.
6. Optionally choose one or more **Labels** to assign to the snippet.
7. Choose whether the snippet will be **Private** using the toggle in the footer.
8. Click **Save** to create the snippet.

Congratulations! You've created your first Cacher snippet.
