# Snippets

Snippets can be used to remember many different pieces of information. Here are a few tips on using them in Cacher.

## Markdown

[Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is one of the most widely used snippet types in Cacher for documentation. We've added a few enhancements to make it even more useful.

To create a Markdown snippet, simply give your snippet file a `.md` extension or click the **dropdown arrow** next to the **New Snippet** button and choose **Markdown**.

### Task Lists

You can create Task Lists to keep track of todos and other checklists. Click the **Add a task list** button in the Markdown editor toolbar to add a Task List item. You can also enter [the syntax](https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/108f62b6b8d8dd18610c#F0_MH--syntax) into the editor directly.

### Attachments

You can directly upload images or files to insert into your Markdown document. Click the **Attach File** button and select one or more files to upload. 

For an even faster way of uploading files, just **drag and drop** them into the editor area.

### Exporting

You can export Markdown files by clicking on **HTML** or **PDF** options in the snippet file header.

## Syncing with GitHub Gist

Any users who have signed in with GitHub will automatically have their personal library snippets synced with GitHub Gist. [Learn more](https://www.cacher.io/docs/guides/snippets/syncing-with-github-gist) about sync.

## Snippet File History

Every snippet file in Cacher comes with its own update history. Examine diffs and restore previous versions with a snippet file's **View history** tab.
