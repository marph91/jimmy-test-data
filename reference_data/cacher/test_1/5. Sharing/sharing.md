Every snippet in Cacher has a corresponding page on [Snippets](https://snippets.cacher.io/), our community hub for sharing code. The page's visibility is dependent on whether the snippet is **public or private** and the **Privacy Setting** for the page.

Here are a few examples of snippet pages:
- [Markdown Task Lists in Cacher](https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/108f62b6b8d8dd18610c)
- [Svelte is really fast](https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/37dc3da63ce006296521)
- [DigitalOcean Rails/Ubuntu/NGINX (16.04) Setup](https://snippets.cacher.io/snippet/c5e2fa72232958b9275e)
