A team allows you and your colleagues to collaborate on a shared library of snippets and labels. They are the best way to disseminate best practices and onboard new team members.

## Team libraries

Every team has its own library, comprised of snippets and labels. Any **owner**, **member** or **manager** is able to view and contribute snippets to the library. In addition, any changes to the team library will be synced to teammates signed into Cacher.

## Starting a Team

![](https://cdn.cacher.io/intro-snippets/starting-a-team.gif)

1. Click on the **Start a Team** button in the left-side library selector bar.
2. Enter a **Team Name**.
3. Enter a **Screenname**.
4. Click the **Create Team** button to continue.
5. From here, you will [invite team members](https://www.cacher.io/docs/getting-started/creating-a-team#add-members-1), [assign roles](https://www.cacher.io/docs/guides/teams/team-members-and-roles), choose whether to enable [code reviews](https://www.cacher.io/docs/guides/teams/code-reviews) and set [policies](https://www.cacher.io/docs/guides/teams/policies) for the created team.

## Team members and roles

Adding new members to your team gives them access to the team's snippets and labels.

### Team members vs organization members

- **Team Member**: A Cacher user who has access to the library of a Team.
- **Organization Member**: A Cacher user who has been added to an organization account. Account members have access to all the capabilities of a Team Plan, like being able to create and join teams. The owner of the org account is either subscribed to a Team Plan or is on a Team Trial. [Learn more](https://www.cacher.io/docs/guides/orgs/org-members-and-roles) about organizations.
