This is an entry intended to demonstrate (most?) of the features of Day One. It is intended to provide an example for a potential Obsidian import plugin.

Day One supports basic markdown directly.

Unicode is supported, including emoji (ðŸŒ‹) and non-english scripts (å¯Œå£«å±±). Words can be **bold**, *italic*, ***bold and italic***, and highlighted. Links are supported, both as text ([Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)) and inline (https://obsidian.md).

A numbered list:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

A bullet list:

A check list:

- [ ] Three

A combination list with nesting:

Inline `code` is supported. Code blocks can either be used to provide code:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```


```

```
```
echo "Hello world!"
```


Or as a way of specifying more complex markdown (including embedded HTML).

| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
| -----:|:-----:|:----- |
|     A |   B   | C     |

<a href="https://obsidian.md">An HTML link.</a>


Block quotes are also supported, and single line breaks are allowed:

> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
> And sorry I could not travel both
> And be one traveler, long I stood
> And looked down one as far as I could
> To where it bent in the undergrowth;
> 
> Then took the other, as just as fair
> And having perhaps the better claim,
> Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
> Though as for that, the passing there
> Had worn them really about the same,
> 
> And both that morning equally lay
> In leaves no step had trodden black
> Oh, I kept the first for another day!
> Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
> I doubted if I should ever come back.
> 
> I shall be telling this with a sigh
> Somewhere ages and ages hence:
> Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,
> I took the one less traveled by,
> And that has made all the difference.

Journals can have tags with spaces applied, or also be #TaggedInline (but inline tags canâ€™t have spaces). They can have other metadata associated with them, like weather conditions, a location, and an activity. Finally, entries can be pinned or favorited.
