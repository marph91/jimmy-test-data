To link relatively to any page **up** in the hierarchy which **shares a parent with the current page** or **that is a sibling** from the current page, do not use a preceding character:
[Relative link to the root page](../../Root%20Page.md)
[Relative Link to Sub Sub Page 1-2 (which shares Sub Page 1 as a parent)](Sub%20Sub%20Page%201-2.md)
