## **Quick Start**
- There's very little to know to start using Roam.
### Everything is a block
- **Each bullet you see is a *block*, and we write them inside pages like this one.**
    - We create new blocks by pressing `Enter`; and nest them using `Tab` (press`Shift+Tab` to unindent)-
        - This creates *children blocks*, which we can expand, collapse, and focus. 
        - Indenting provides structure. We can scan pages with ease and find related blocks. Try clicking the **·êÖ** icon on the next block!
### Everything is where you need it to be
- **Organizing information is effortless with** [page](<./Page References.md>)/[block references](<./Block References.md>).
    - Let's say we have a meeting. In our Daily Notes, we might write
        - [QhoXgk8VU](<./February 1st, 2021.md>)
    - Those square brackets turn text into ***backlinks***.
        - This automatically creates a page for each keyword--click the backlink to go the keyword's page. 
        - At the bottom, you'll find instances where the page was mentioned--its *page references*.
        - So the meeting reminder block appears on [meeting](./meeting.md), [John Smith](<./John Smith.md>), [marketing](./marketing.md), and [Roam Research](<./Roam Research.md>)!
        - This way, we never have to worry about which folder to file things in- just [backlink](./backlink.md) as you go.
### Everything is a `/` away
- Roam is packed with powerful features. Anytime you want to do more than type text,
    - just type `/` to bring up the inline command palette.
        - If you don't find what you're looking for, click on the Help
        -  icon in the top right of the page! If you can think it, you can do it in Roam.
