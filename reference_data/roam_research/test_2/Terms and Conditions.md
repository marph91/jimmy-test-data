- **V. Release.**
    - If either Party has a dispute with one or more Users, this Party releases the other Party (and their officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

        - “Public Databases” that can be accessed by anyone with the link. The user that created the Database retains administrative rights. You can allow the database to be fully editable by the public, or you can restrict access to be read-only.
