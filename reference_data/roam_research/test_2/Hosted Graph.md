- What does it mean?
    - If it's a private graph (you're the only person accessing it)
        - You are able to access your Roam graph anywhere with its URL once you're logged into your account 
    - If it's shared with selected individuals
        - The shared accounts can either read or edit your graph, when they log into Roam and open your graph's URL
        - See [Sharing](Sharing.md) for more info
    - If it's publicly available
        - Anyone can see your graph via its URL
        - See [Sharing](Sharing.md) for more info
- How many can you make?
    - as many as you want :)
- Where is it hosted?
    - Google Firebase
- Can I access it offline?
    - Yes, but your changes won't be synced to our servers until you're back online when the sync button becomes green

        - So be careful of closing Roam or clearing the cache of your browser (as data will be temporarily stored there)
