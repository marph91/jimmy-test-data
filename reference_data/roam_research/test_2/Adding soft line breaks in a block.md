- Each individual bullet point in a page in Roam is referred to as a block.  When you press enter Roam creates a new block on the next line in your page.  Here's an example from a test page where I create five separate blocks.

- It's also possible to create blocks that include soft line breaks between text.  If you have a block with a lot of text, rather than have all your text as a slab, using soft lines breaks allows you to space out this text within a single block.
- To add a soft line break press enter + shift.  You can then write on a new line, but it remains in the same block.  Here's an example where I add soft line breaks by pressing enter + shift five times between the first and second sentence. In contrast to the first example, both of these sentences in the second example remain in the same block. You can notice this because there are no bullets between the top and bottom sentence.

- Adding soft line breaks is a nice formatting tool, it allows you to create blocks with a lot of rich information such as paragraphs but also giving the text a more readable style with these blocks.
