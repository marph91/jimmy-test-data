# Fedora

This only works in Fedora 30 and earlier. PYGtkSourceView2, one of Cherrytree's dependencies, is obsolete and removed from Fedora in version 31 and later.

	1. Install Python2
	
	

	2. Install Cherrytreeâ€™s core dependencies with the command:

	

	3. (**Optional**) Install dependencies for additional functionality:

		- To use an appindicator in systray instead of the standard systray.
		   
				

		- For multiple instances centralization. (Double-clicking a file that is already open displays the open document instead of opening another instance of that file.)
		
				

		- For spell check fuctionality.
		   
				

		- For better decoding support of imported and pasted text.
		   
				

	4. [Clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) or download the [Cherrytree repository](https://github.com/giuspen/cherrytree).

	5. Open a terminal, change to the directory containing your local copy of Cherrytree, and run:
	
	
	
```sh
sudo dnf install python2
```

```sh
sudo dnf install pygtk2 pygtksourceview p7zip p7zip-plugins
```

```sh
sudo dnf install python-appindicator
```

```sh
sudo dnf install python-dbus
```

```sh
sudo dnf install python-enchant
```

```sh
sudo dnf install python-chardet
```

```sh
python2 cherrytree
```
