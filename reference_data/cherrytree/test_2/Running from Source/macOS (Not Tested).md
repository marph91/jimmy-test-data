# macOS (Not Tested)


	Cherrytree is not supported for macOS but can be installed from source using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
	
	1. Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/).

	2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

	3. Install Cherrytreeâ€™s core dependencies using Homebrew and the following commands:
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	4. (**Optional**) Install dependencies for additional functionality using **PIP** (a package manager for Python):

		-  For spell check functionality.
		
		
		
		-  For better decoding support of imported and pasted text.
		
		

	5. [Clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) or download the [Cherrytree repository](https://github.com/giuspen/cherrytree).

	6. Open a terminal, change to the directory containing your local copy of Cherrytree, and run:
