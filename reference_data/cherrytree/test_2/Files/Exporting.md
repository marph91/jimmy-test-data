# Exporting


	To export notes from another file:

	1. Select one of the following options from the **Export** menu:

		- Export to PDF

		- Export to HTML

		- Export to Multiple Plain Text Files

		- Export to Single Plain Text File

		- Export to CherryTreeDocument

	2. Within the **Involved Nodes** menu, select the scope of your document to be exported:
	
		- Selected Text Only

		- Selected Node Only

		- Selected Node and Subnodes

		- All in Tree

	3. Additional options are available depending on the export type:
	
		- **Include Node name** - Displays the name of each Node at the top of its page. This may be redundant if you have headers within the pages of your notes.

		- **New Node in New Page** - Applies page breaks at the end of nodes within the exported document.

		- **Links Tree in Every Page** - When enabled all web pages contain a table of contents. If this option is disabled, only the **index.html** contains a table of contents.

	When exporting to HTML, all nodes are copied to the root folder of your chosen directory as **.html** files. The main HTML file is named **index.html**.
