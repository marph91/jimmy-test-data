# Get Involved


	New contributors are welcome! We recommend that you [contact the project’s maintainer](http://mailto:giuspen@gmail.com) before working on a feature.

 ## Development

	Visit the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/giuspen/cherrytree) to get started.

	Development is currently focused on porting from Python to C++/GTKmm. These changes are located on the master branch within the [future directory](https://github.com/giuspen/cherrytree/tree/master/future). The latest stable release can also be found on the master branch. The pygi branch is a discontinued attempt to port to the python bindings for GTK3. It failed due to missing pygi bindings for core clipboard functionality.

	Developers can help by addressing bugs submitted to the repository’s [issues page](https://github.com/giuspen/cherrytree/issues).

 ## Testing

	If you find a bug, check to see if it has already been reported within the project’s [issues page](https://github.com/giuspen/cherrytree/issues). If the error is unreported, create a new issue providing as much detail as possible.

	If needed, here is a short guide on [writing a proper GitHub issue](https://medium.com/nycplanninglabs/writing-a-proper-github-issue-97427d62a20f).

 ## Writing

	The web version of the Cherrytree user manual is written using [asciidoctor](https://asciidoctor.org/) and is [maintained on GitHub](https://github.com/EllieBorden/Cherrytree-Manual). Contributors can help with writing and proofing, or by porting the manual to a .**ctb** version intended to demonstrate Cherrytree’s potential. 

 ## Translation

	Contact the project’s [maintainer](http://mailto:giuspen@gmail.com) to add or edit translations.
