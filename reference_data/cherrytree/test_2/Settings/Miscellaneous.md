 ## System Tray

	- **Enable System Tray Docking** - Closing Cherrytree minimizes the application to a background process which can be more quickly accessed from the machine’s system tray. **AppIndicator **may be required to access Cherrytree from the system tray in Linux.

	- **Start Minimized in the System Tray** - Minimizes Cherrytree to the system tray on startup.

	- **Use AppIndicator for Docking** - (Linux only) Uses the appindicator feature to provide quick access to Cherrytree from your system tray.

 ## Saving

	- **Autosave Every ****`x`**** Minutes** - Saves the working document every **`x`** minutes, where **`x`** represents the number defined in this setting.

	- **Autosave on Quit** - Saves the document upon closing Cherrytree.

	- **Create a Backup Copy Before Saving** - Stores a copy of the previous version before saving the new version. Backups are stored in the same directory as the current document.
	
**		To open a backup:**
	
		1. Rename the backup file, deleting the **`~`** characters appended to its extension.

		2. Open the backup file within Cherrytree.

	- **Number of Backups to Keep** - Defines the number of backups to keep. The oldest backup is removed when this limit is exceeded.

			**CAUTION:** This also applies to autosaves that run on a time interval. For example, if your application is configured to save every 5 minutes, Cherrytree creates a backup every five minutes. When the backup limit is exceeded, a backup is cycled out every 5 minutes.

 ## Miscellaneous

	- **Automatically Check for Newer Version** - Checks the Cherrytree website on startup to determine if a new version of the application is available for download.

	- **Reload Document from Last Session** - Cherrytree opens to the same document that was last opened in the previous session.

	- **Reload After External Update to CT* File** - Cherrytree refreshes its instance of a document to reflect changes made to the document from other instances.

	**WARNING:** Cherrytree is not intended to be used as a collaboration tool. Only edit one instance of a document at a time. Editing two or more instances of a document at the same time yields a high potential for errors and data loss.
