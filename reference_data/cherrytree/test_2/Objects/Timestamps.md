# Timestamps


	By default, this feature inserts the date in time in a format such as YYYY/mm/dd - HH:MM, where Y = year, m = month, d = day, H = hour, and M = minute.

 ## Inserting a Timestamp

	Select **Insert Timestamp **from the **Edit **menu to insert a timestamp.

 ## Formatting a Timestamp

	The format of the timestamp can be configured in the [text and code preference menu](../Settings/Text%20and%20Code.md).
