#### **Idea Behind the POSIX Kernel**
- **Purpose:**
- To create a lightweight, **POSIX-compliant kernel** that adheres to industry standards, making it suitable for running standard Unix applications.
- Focused on modularity, scalability, and portability for learning and advanced use cases.


- **Goals:**
- Provide a **kernel from scratch** that implements essential POSIX functionalities, such as:â–ª Process management (fork, exec).
- File system operations.
- Signals and inter-process communication (IPC).


- Enable compatibility with existing POSIX-compliant libraries and applications.


- **Vision:**
- A robust, educational kernel for developers wanting to understand how POSIX standards work at the system level.
- A foundation for custom Unix-like operating systems.
