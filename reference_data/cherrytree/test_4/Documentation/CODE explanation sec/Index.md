#### **Code Explanation Sections**
**Section 1: Bootloader**
- Multiboot2 header and transition to kernel entry point.
- Explain how GRUB loads the kernel and passes control.

**Section 2: Process Management**
- Explain the `fork()` implementation:- Task duplication using process control blocks (PCB).


- Show how `exec()` works to replace the process memory space.

**Section 3: File System**
- Explain the abstraction provided by the VFS layer.
- How system calls like `open` and `read` interact with VFS.

**Section 4: Signal Handling**
- Discuss the signal delivery mechanism.
- Explain how handlers are invoked during task execution.

**Section 5: Inter-Process Communication**
- Describe the creation and usage of pipes.
- Explain the shared memory implementation.

#### **Page 7: Challenges and Roadmap**
**Challenges:**
- Managing context switches and process isolation.
- Implementing robust file systems.
- Debugging low-level interactions with hardware.

**Roadmap:**
1. Develop bootloader and kernel entry point.
