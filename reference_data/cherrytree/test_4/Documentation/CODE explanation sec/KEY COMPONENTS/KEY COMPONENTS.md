This **bootloader** is designed to load a **Multiboot-compliant kernel** from disk and transfer control to the kernel's entry point. It works in tandem with an assembly file (`bootasm.S`), which sets the CPU into **protected mode (32-bit)** before invoking `bootmain()`.
Here's a detailed breakdown of the code:


### **Key Components**

#### 1. **Multiboot Header (****`struct mbheader`****)**
The Multiboot header is a structure used to identify a Multiboot-compliant kernel and provide necessary metadata about how to load the kernel.

```
struct mbheader {
  uint32 magic;         // Multiboot magic number (0x1BADB002)
  uint32 flags;         // Flags indicating supported features
  uint32 checksum;      // Ensures (magic + flags + checksum) == 0
  uint32 header_addr;   // Address of the Multiboot header
  uint32 load_addr;     // Physical address to load the kernel
  uint32 load_end_addr; // End address of the kernel in memory
  uint32 bss_end_addr;  // End address of the uninitialized data segment (BSS)
  uint32 entry_addr;    // Address of the kernel's entry point
};

```
