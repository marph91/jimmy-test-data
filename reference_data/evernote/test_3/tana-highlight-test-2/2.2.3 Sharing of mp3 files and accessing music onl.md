There were a range of different types of consumer behaviour in respect to accessing music online in 1998 and 1999. The e-commerce trend that had effected industry generally too appeared in music, and there were a range of retailers that sold CDs directly to the public via the internet. It was in this period too, prior to Napster, that downloading of music began to surge in popularity, moving from a niche interest to a nascent mainstream behaviour. 
In respect to e-commerce, CDBaby and CDNow established themselves as leading online CD retail intermediaries. Whilst these businesses for the most part didn’t offer downloading, capitalising on both consumers familiarity and demand for CDs, as well as the newly established consumer PC capacity, these stores created infrastructure that allowed consumers to purchase CDs on the internet and have them delivered to their home. Highlighting still how adolescent commerce infrastructure on the internet was at this point, Derek Sivers, founder of CD Baby, who himself was a musician and previous user of IUMA, highlights that there was not paypal, so getting the buy it now button on his website was a major achievement (Sivers ##).
By 1997, IUMA had been around for a number of years, and offered users ability to access free music online from independent musicians. There were also a range of websites such as eMusic, Goodnoise, mp3.com as well as through the Winamp website that similarly allowed consumers to access and download music from independent musicians, or music from small labels which had licensed their music to these sites. There was not yet anyway to pay and download mainstream music owned by the major labels.
The long download times for individual music files, particularly using 56K modem where downloading a 49.41MB album could take more than 2 hours(Gillen 4 November 2000), at this point constrained consumer take up of downloading of music.  Due to the performance constraints of the internet, whilst it was possible to download music from the internet using PCs, burning CDs was a much more popular consumer behaviour in 1997 and early 1998. However, in 1998, even with the technical limitations of downloading, widespread interest in mp3 first emerged: "A largely underground phenomenon in 1997, the controversial MP3 file-compression format burst from obscurity last year [1998]” (Reece 9 January 1999).  By May 1999, ‘mp3’ had become the second most popular search term on the internet (Dyson 1 May 1999) continuing to grow. In a matter of months, by October 1999 it had eclipsed all other terms to be the most searched term on the internet, with mp3 now "more popular than sex” (Jones and Sul 14 October 1999). The speed of uptake of the format, and the manner it emerged from obscurity led Michael Robertson of mp3.com to highlight that this shift was the most significant development in digital music of the time: “The real story is that MP3 has incredibly quickly evolved into a full-blown mainstream movement” (Robertson, in Strauss 5 April 1999). 
Attempting to capitalise on the growing interest in mp3, there were a range of websites that focussed specifically on helping users find mp3 files. Scour.net, mp3meta and Mp3.lycos were leading mp3 file search engine and indexes (PC Computing 1 July 1999). Lycos, one of the leading search engines of the time, established a separate webpage specifically dedicated to mp3 files. Mp3.lycos allowed users to search for individual mp3 files by song name or artist title, with Mp3.lycos retrieving and compiling a list of websites where these files could be found. The directory was very popular, with search results for individual files offering links to tens to hundreds of websites that contained the particular file the user was searching for (Hoye 29 March 1999). Often though, the search results were unreliable, offering links that would be broken or expired for individual files, making for a frustrating user experience. Shawn Fanning soon would cite this unreliability as a motivator for Napster which was still yet to be conceived (Aydar 28 September 2005).

Not only was accessing music online becoming a popular activity, but adding to this, sharing of mp3 files soon followed.  With many users having large libraries of mp3 files on their hard drives from CD ripping and mp3 encoding software, soon references emerged in early 1999 that described the increasingly common activity of music sharing. One way was relatively innoucously, via email: "Thousands of teenagers now routinely e-mail music to their friends”(Rawsthorn 13 January 1999), but for more advanced computer users, particularly those users in college withaccessto broadbandinternetconnections in their dorms, Internet Relay Chat (IRC) groups offered capacity to share pirated software, music and movies. In 1998 Jeff Levy was one such college student attheUniversity of Oregon. He was a user of a IRC channel called Warez being particularly active in a sub group called ISO Traders. Levy was also soon to be the first person prosecuted for illegal file sharing under the newNet Act. 
Having broadband access in his dorm, as well as a computer with CD Burner capacity, Levy became aware and interested in Warez Channel whilst exploring IRC. Warez was a popular IRC channel that came to represent a large amount of sub channelsthatallowed users to share unlawfullycopied software. Most of these channels required individual membership where users would have to upload content in order to access content to download. Whilst Warez wasn’t widely popular with mainstream audiences due to theadvancedunderstanding required to use, it certainly was well known within IRC community, as well as leading to wider attempts to popularise it, such as a 117 page book published by a Warez userthatexplained how to use it, and how it facilitated piracy (<http://www.particalwave.com/media%5Cwmw.pdf>). 
![Screen Shot 2015-12-22 at 6.19.44 pm.png](<./Screen Shot 2015-12-22 at 6.19.44 pm.png>)
Levy appeared curiousabout Warez and morespecifically the smaller ISOTrader group, and recognised that his computer had the capacity to contribute to the group. He also acknowledged that whilst he didn’t have any specific coding ability, Warez didn’t require skills that werebeyond hisfamiliarity with computers,andthatstandard CD burnersoftware offered this as standard:
*I'm like oh, this is something I can do because I have a CD burner and I have a really fast connection to where I can download, 600MB image file in 10, 15 minutes...but what was interesting, in a way, too, was that you no longer required any sort of knowledge of writing code or changing the packing, [to] pirate the software...You didn't necessarily have to do that anymore.Because you have the CD burner to do that.*
Levy describes his involvement in the ISOTraders IRCchannelas social just as much asaboutgetting access to content, often chatting through IRC with the other mostly college student membership ofthegroup. Because ofhis reliable FTP connection, as well as because of the desire to engage in this community socially by continuing to offer content,Levy became a popular host of content within the ISO Traders channel. Whilst he was using astandardPC with standard components,ISO Trader members from around the world were accessing files hosted on Levy’s computer, downloading these files at consistent rates, resulting in inflatedinternettraffic to Levy’suniversitylocation.  Whilst this traffic wasn’t large by today’s standard, it was large and consistent at the time particularly in comparison to other students: "Typical output during a two-hour period was 1.7 gigabytes but the average two-hour output of college students that use this university being 0.94 megabytes”. Levy describes thecontent he hosted intheISO Traders group asa mix ofsoftware, including games and professionalsoftwarelike Autodesk 3DX Max, as well as music, with Levy suggesting music made up about 25% of the entire library.
The heightenedbandwidthuse compared to otherstudents alerted University of Oregon Network administrators. Without consultation withLevy to warn him or explore the issue, University Administrators referred the use to police,who then referred the issue to the FBI. Levy soon would learn of the FBI’s interest in him, buthighlighting his motivations for the activity as driven more by socialactivityas well as exploring the capacity of the technology more than being a largescaleorganised piracy operator, Levy initially had no idea why the FBI had contacted him:
*It was a morning and I was getting ready for work. I had just gotten out of the shower and when I came out of the shower the phone was ringing in my apartment. And I picked up the phone and they said, "Jeff, this is the FBI. We're at your door.And I said, "Well, just give me a sec to get dressed because I'm still in my towel," and, and you know, got dressed. I let them in. They were right there and I still I think was ... I remember sort of going through my head while I was getting dressed, "Why are they at my door?". And I just, you know, thought well, maybe it's just something else going on in the area or something.And pretty soon I figured out why. They told me why they were there. I think there was someone from the news there, too, with a news camera at that moment.*
Levy became the first person ever to be prosecuted under the No Electronic Theft Act, and after pleading guilty the first felony guilty plea.  Whilst the bandwidththatwas being used byLevy was large compared to other student users, he was not a large scale coordinator of copyrighted material, which was first suspected by the University as well as FBI.  Levy cites that ISO Traders had approximately 20 active members at any point in time, and that there were much larger IRC Warez channels that had much larger libraries of pirated material aswellas many more active users. Whilstthemaximumsentence under the act was 3 years imprisonment and and a fine of up to $250,000, Levy served no prison time and was left largely only with a lawyer bill of over $10,000. Hissentencealso included ongoing restricted internet access. The case attracted a largeamountof attention for a momentary time, with Levy’s case beingdiscussedat Harvard, as well as by celebrities such as Chuck D from the high profile band Public Enemy offering public support to him. Levy wasn’t involved in an organised piracy ring, instead he was a university student given fast internet and a computer with a CD burner.  Reflecting ontheexperience, Levy who now lives in a remote area oftheUS with almost no access to theinternet, reflects on the experience:
*I think it was just I was just shocked by the whole thing in some ways and just, I mean, for a while it was just sort of like is this for real? But it was pretty obvious that, yeah, it was. And I think at first I was just so shocked by it that I was really miffed but then once the whole thing started to come into view over time, too, especially after a year or so had passed, I became a little bit more upset about it. I always thought, too, one of the telltale things is that my Mom and my Dad were very supportive. There was never a moment when they were, "I can't believe you were doing this.”,"What the hell were you thinking? This is horrible." They were both just sort of like, "Well, you obviously shouldn’t have been doing this, but you're getting fucked over and this is totally unnecessary for what you were doing.”​And, you know, "How can we support you?" That felt good to at least know my parents, whether they had my back or not, they definitely would've but I guess, but not only did they have my back but they were kind of with me on it where I was like, "Yeah, I'm getting fucked over unnecessarily."*
Levy’s sentiments toward the case would soon befurther tested when Napster emerged. The contradiction between Levy being prosecuted compared to widespread piracy by Napster users, who downloaded and uploaded music at a muchlarger scale than Levy ever did, makes thepursuitand justification of his case complex.

"Some legitimacy has been bestowed on MP3, with Lycos establishing a special MP3 search page, and the development of portable MP3 music players such as Diamond Multimedia's Rio player, which can be loaded with more than an hour's worth of MP3 files from a PC. However,legal steps have been taken to restrict the circulation of thismusic format. The Recording Industry Association of America Inc. recently failed in a bid to prevent the sale of the Rio player onthe grounds that it encouraged piracy. Meanwhile, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry has launched legal action against the Norwegian technology company, FAST Search & Transfer ASA, developers of the Lycos search engine”(Dyson 1 May 1999)
“Web sites everywhere posted songs by artists large and small for some time, but in December 1997, the term mp3 became well-known- not just to those versed in technology but to readersofthe mainstream music media. Four ofthemost popular artists on the planet- Pearl Jam, Madonna, U2 and Alanis Morisette- had unreleased songs leaked to the public ontheInternet through mp3. Publikitedgenerated through released Mp3s could become a dominant form of publicity that major labelseventuallygarner from the mp3 format on the Internet”(Frankel Greely and Sawyer 1999 p. 11)
"A radio station in Syracuse, NY began playing cuts from Pearl Jam’s unreleased album *Yield*nearly three months before the album’s release. A number of Web sites posted the songs. Long after the band’s loyal fans had ample opportunity todownloadthe songs, Epic Records searched mp3s of *Yield*and had as many of the songs pulled as possible. While the record label andRecordingIndustry Association ofAmericaquickly hopped on the anti-mp3 bandwagon, none other than Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard told online music new source *Addicted to Noise*that he was flattered som many people cared about hearing new music from the band”(Frankel Greely and Sawyer 1999 p. 11)
“By thetimea Los Angeles radiostationplayed an unreleased Morisette song in March 1998, she wasjustthelatest superstar act to have a song leaked to radio and eventually released worldwidethanksto the Internet. As *Addicted to Noise’**s* Chris Nelson wrote,“It’s a scenario that has become almost as commonplace as mosh pits at rock shows: A song is recoded, it’s leaked to radio, and hours- or even minutes- later, it’sbroadcastto the world via the Internet by enterprising fans”(Frankel Greely and Sawyer 1999 p. 11)
